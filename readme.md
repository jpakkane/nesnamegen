# Video game name generator

The [Game Scoop
podcast](https://www.ign.com/videos/game-scoop-768-square-enix-takes-the-l)
had an idea for a video game name generator that takes random words
from existing NES titles.

This repo is an implementation of said idea. The game list data is
copied [from
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Entertainment_System_games).
